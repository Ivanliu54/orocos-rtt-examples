We're going to write the whole supervisor in Lua.

1. Create a LuaComponent during deployment
2. Create a .lua state machine script 
   a. having the state layout as in Supervisor.png
   b. having the state transitions as in Supervisor.png (i.e. event responses)
3. Start/stop the controller in/out circling mode
4. Start/stop the joystick in/out manual mode
