                      OROCOS RTT >= 2.4 Tutorial

This directory contains exercises for exploring the Orocos Real-Time
Toolkit in order to learn how to create Orocos components.

Each exercise compiles out of the box. It is your task to extend it
such that it becomes more functional.

Start with the hello-1-task-execution directory and work your way down
until you have done all hello-* examples.  The assignment can be found
at the top of each HelloWorld.cpp file.

When you're done with the hello-* examples, proceed with the
controller-1 example, which has instructions in its Exercise.txt file.

Requirements: 

Orocos Real-Time Toolkit 2.4 or later and the Orocos Component Library's
DeploymentComponent and TaskBrowser component are installed. Use ROS
for automatic dependency resolution, or set your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
to the lib/cmake/orocos-rtt directory where the FindOrocos-RTT.cmake file
was installed.

Eclipse users:

IMPORTANT: see http://www.orocos.org/wiki/rtt/eclipse for correctly setting up Eclipse.

You need Eclipse Ganymede (3.4) or better with the C/C++ toolkit support.

Start Eclipse, select the C/C++ perspective (right top) Use
'File'->'Import...'->'Existing projects into Workspace' and point it
to this directory or this archive. It will see that all examples are
Eclipse projects.  Select them all and press Finish.

ROS users can just use 'make eclipse-project' in their build directory
and import that generated project.

Feel free to contribute other examples on Orocos.org.

Have fun!
