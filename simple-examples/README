RTT Examples for building Components.

All examples except 'motioncontrol' are built using the 'make'
command:

  $ cd example
  $ make OROPATH=/usr/local

enter a subdirectory and invoke make with the installation path of 
Orocos.

IMPORTANT:
 These examples require that the `orocos-rtt' library and that the
`orocos-ocl' library are installed *IN THE SAME LOCATION* (like
/usr/local). The OCL is required to contain the TaskBrowser component.

Before you start the application, type (with OROPATH=/usr/local):
 
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
 
OR:
 
as the 'root' user, add the line
  /usr/local/lib
to /etc/ld.so.conf and run the 'ldconfig' program.
 
The second option is easier, as you only need to do it once.


The 'motioncontrol' example is built using the 'cmake' system
(http://www.cmake.org):

  $ cd motioncontrol
  $ cmake .  [or: ccmake . ]
  $ make
