This example requires that the OCL is configured with the KUKA
component of the HARDWARE section, and the VIEWER, MOTION and NAXES
components. REPORTING and TASKBROWSER is required as well.

mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. [ or ccmake .. to set paths ]

make

cd src
ln -s ../../cpf
ln -s ../../programs
ln -s ../../states

./robotdemo

Then start the state machine:

Default.activate()
Default.start()

Now you can proceed with MoveToCartesian commands.

MoveToCartesian(frame(vector(1.4,1.0,0.0), rotation(90.0,0.0,0.0)))

** This is a very complex demo with little instructions. **
