This examples requires that the `orocos-rtt' library has been
built with Corba support (using make rtt-corba).

This demo can be started by running ./startdemo.sh, if you 
have set the ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT environment variables correctly.
If you installed ACE/TAO from distribution packages, these 
variables are probably not needed and it will compile anyway.

See startdemo.sh to see the action which must be taken to start
a CORBA server and a client.
