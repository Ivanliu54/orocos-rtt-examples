This application demonstrates that it is possible to 
get an Orocos application running < 400KB.

In order to compile Orocos for embedded usage, do:

* Disable the RealTime Toolkit
* Select the 'Embedded Operating System' flag in
  the 'Operating System' package
* Remove the 'Program Parser' and 'Properties Marshalling'
  packages.
* Compile for 'Execution' (-O3) in the 'Global Build Flags'

Use 'strip' to strip symbol information from the executable
in order to see the actual code size.
