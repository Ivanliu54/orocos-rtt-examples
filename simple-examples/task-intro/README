Task Introduction Example
-------------------------

Building :
The Makefile assumes orocos is installed in /usr/local.
Modify the Makefile to an alternative path if needed. Then 
compile with 'make all'.

This small example demonstrates 3 Orocos Tasks. The
'FactoringTask' waits for a command to factor a number
in its primes. When done, it fires an event with the result.
The 'ReactiveTask' is a periodic task which waits for
the events to happen when it is running. The 'PeriodicTask'
can count to a certain number in each periodic step,
when given the command to do so.

When the application starts, you get the TaskBrowser's prompt.
You can send commands to the other tasks or 'cd' to the other
tasks and then give the command. Read the 'help' carefully
or read the Orocos Component Builders Manual.
